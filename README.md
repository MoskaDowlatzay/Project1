# Overview
We created a website where user can find recipes from all over the world and check out some food related news as an extra.
User story: 
As a user, I want to find recipes local to a specific country. 
I will click on a country name and relevant recipes will appear.
Countries I click will be saved to my search history, so I can access them again.
If I scroll further down the webpage, articles related to food and recipes will be displayed on cards, which I can click on to read the full article.
